**Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning**
 Project Overview
This project predicts the selling price of cars using machine learning techniques. It analyses key features such as brand, model year, mileage, fuel type, and engine power to estimate prices accurately. The project demonstrates the use of regression models in real-world price prediction.

**Features**
- Data preprocessing and feature encoding  
- Regression model training (Random Forest)  
- Model evaluation using R², MAE, and RMSE  
- Visualisation of actual vs predicted prices  
- Feature importance analysis  

**Tech Stack**
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

 **Workflow**
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data preprocessing and encoding  
3. Model training and prediction  
4. Model evaluation  
5. Visualisation of results  

 **Results**
The Random Forest Regressor performed best with a high R² score, accurately predicting car prices and highlighting the most influential features.

**Real-World Application**
This model can help car sellers and buyers estimate fair market prices based on various attributes, supporting data-driven decision-making in the automobile sector.
